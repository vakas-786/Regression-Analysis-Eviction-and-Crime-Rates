# Regression-Analysis-Eviction-and-Crime-Rates

# About
My final assignment for my Econometrics class this past spring required me to perform a regression analysis on a topic of my choice. At the time, the pandemic was raging on in the months of March and April as I was completing my senior year from home as classes were now online. I decided to perform a regression analysis comparing eviction rates with violent crime. I also included unemployment rates as evictions are mostly caused by missed payments due to factors such as unemployment. I used R to perform my analysis from the data that I had collected and cleaned up. To take a look at my code take a look the file labeled Vakas_project.R, I included comments for readers to follow along and see what my code did. To view my full analysis you can find it <a href="https://vakas-786.github.io/Regression-Analysis-Eviction-and-Crime-Rates/Econometrics%20Final%20Paper.pdf">here</a>. Below you can find a condensed version of my conclusions. Enjoy!
